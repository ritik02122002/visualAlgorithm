# Visual Algo - Algorithm Visualizer
## An interactive algorithm visualizer that demonstrates various **Recursive, Dynamic programming, Sorting and Searching algorithms**.  
* Allows users to input custom data sets and visualize the step-by-step execution of algorithms.
* Supported visualization of **Tower of Hanoi, Maximal square of all 1â€™s in a binary matrix, Bubble sort, Linear and
Binary search**, showcasing their time complexity and efficiency.
* Incorporated animations and real-time logs to enhance the visual understanding of algorithm behavior.  
* Speed of the algorithms can be adjusted as per convenience.  
* Maintaining a running tally of swaps and moves for Bubble sort and Tower of Hanoi respectively.
* Technology Used: **HTML, CSS, Javascript**.  
* Deployed at: https://visual-algorithm.vercel.app/
